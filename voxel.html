      Eadweard Muybridge was a monumental figure in the history of photography and motion picture technology, bridging the gap between still photography and the advent of motion pictures. Our project is inspired by his work, but rather than trying to capture motion through photography, we are attempting to capture it through sculpture. We selected the above three images to test whether all three of these images could be represented via different angles of viewing within one multimaterial 3d print. To accomplish this task, three voxel fields were created, rotated, and baked in Grasshopper. Then, the resulting 3d objects were each shrinkwrapped and converted from mesh to nurbs to find the boolean intersection. Finally, the resulting shape was shrinkwrapped and a mesh was created for the surrounding clear shape in order to show to the using from which angles the different images can be viewed.
